This section introduces the basics of DL Workbench workflow by walking you through the process of importing your first model, creating a project, and evaluating the initial performance. To help you get started with DL Workbench, this guide uses `ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco` [model](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_models_model_ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.html) for [object detection](https://machinelearningmastery.com/object-recognition-with-deep-learning/) use case, trained with [TensorFlow\*](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework. 

To start exploring DL Workbench capabilities right away, complete the following steps:
1. [Import Model](Select_Model.md)
2. [Create Project](Create_Project.md)

This guide goes step-by-step through the workflow described in the Create Project video. Watch it to learn how to get started with DL Workbench:
